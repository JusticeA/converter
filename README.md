# Testing my skills in vanilla JavaScript, CSS3, and BootStrap HTML5 with a converter
This is a converter developed, using pure _HTML_ _CSS_, **_vanilla JavaScript_** and _BootStrap_. 

Thanks to Traversy Media, I was able to understand some fundamentals and I created a weight converter. However, after much playing around, I was able to scale it up to include a temperature, time and area converter. 

More commits, are to be made as time goes on.

**Note:** This program doesn't follow certain JavaScript best practices as such. This is my first program written in JavaScript and I was more concerned with learning and coming up with a working program and ignored certain practices to improve performance, readability and maintenance. Now, that I am done and after going through the JavaScript curriculum in **W3schools.com**, I am fully aware of certain corrections to be made and I plan on making them with further commits. I also welcome feedbacks, as I believe this will help me improve and become a better programmer/developer.
